# About

Personal timeline application for tracking activity, work, projects, text, image with ability to view/import/mirror data from elsewhere. Focus on manual/user explicit tracking, and being interoperable to be useful in this way as part of larger self-observing and so on.

Motivated by... not invented here? Expanding what desire to "track time" is beyond more rigourous business context of billable hours. Timeline, oracle bone.

# To-Do
- [ ] Divine what to do
- [ ] Change data model away from explicit "intervals" to more general atomic "anchor points"
- [ ] Switch frontend from Blazor to Angular or other client side that works gooder
- [ ] Lots of research and mock-ups
